Observations with a Z-score smaller than -3 or larger than 3 can be considered outliers.  

In regression analysis, heteroscedasticity (sometimes spelled heteroskedasticity) refers to
the unequal scatter of residuals or error terms. It refers to the case where there
is a systematic change in the spread of the residuals over the range of measured values.
Heteroscedasticity is a problem because ordinary least squares (OLS) regression assumes that
the residuals come from a population that has homoscedasticity, which means constant variance.

The Akaike information criterion (AIC) is a metric that is used to compare the fit of different 
regression models. The model with the lowest AIC offers the best fit. The absolute value of 
the AIC value is not important.
